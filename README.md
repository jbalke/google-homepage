Google Homepage

As most web traffic is from mobile devices, I decided to attempt mocking up the mobile version of Google's homepage.

I initially thought of implementing media queries for desktop layout but discovered that Google doesn't do this either. Effort saved!

I've wrestled with CSS for a few months now, so consider myself familiar with the basics (semantic html, flexbox, grid) but terrible at design. In this project I've spent most of my time tweaking layouts/whitespace/fontsizes to the pixel to match Google's design, moreso than any prior project where information density is far less.
